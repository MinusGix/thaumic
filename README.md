# Thaumic
A Rust library for creating structures with special behavior/features that can't be replicated with typical Rust structure syntax.  
This is a procedural macro.  
Currently this library is quite unsafe. It tries to be sound and undergoes testing with Miri but has not been tested too strenuously.

## Usage
### Storing and Creating a DST array
```rust
#[]
```
